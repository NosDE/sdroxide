//! RIFP (Radio Image Framing Protocol) vocabulary shared by the engine, the

//!
//! RIFP is a packetised image-transfer protocol: a JSON manifest describes the
//! encoded object, numbered DATA frames carry it, and an END frame repeats the
//! integrity values. Only the identity of the profiles/encodings and the status
//! a panel renders live here; the framing, the modem, and the object codecs are
//! native-side (`sdroxide-dsp::rifp`, `sdroxide-digi::rifp_controller`).

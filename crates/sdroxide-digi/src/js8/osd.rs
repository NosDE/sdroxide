//! Ordered-statistics decoding: the fallback for when belief propagation gives
//! up.
//!
//! BP is iterative and probabilistic — it converges on most frames and simply
//! fails on some, particularly where a few bits are badly wrong rather than
//! many being slightly wrong. OSD attacks the same codeword from the other
//! direction and is deterministic: **trust the most reliable bits, re-derive
//! the rest.**
//!
//! 1. Sort the 174 received bits by `|LLR|` — how confident the demodulator is.
//! 2. Gaussian-eliminate the generator so the 87 most reliable *independent*
//!    positions become the information set.
//! 3. Take the hard decisions on those 87 as the message and re-encode. Every
//!    other bit is now implied by the ones we trust most, so any number of
//!    errors among the unreliable bits is corrected at a stroke.
//! 4. That is order 0. Higher orders flip small combinations of the information
//!    bits and re-encode, keeping whichever candidate lands closest to what was
//!    actually received.
//!
//! Ported from JS8Call's `lib/ft8/osd174.f90`, minus its `npre1`/`npre2`
//! partial-sum pruning: those exist to make the search affordable in Fortran,
//! and re-encoding incrementally (a candidate differing from another by one
//! information bit differs by exactly one generator row) makes the whole
//! order-2 search cost a few thousand XORs instead.
//!
//! Note the LLRs are **not** permuted through `colorder` on the way in, unlike
//! upstream. Ours already are: the generator rows were transcribed from
//! JS8Call's C++ port, which folds that permutation into the row order. See
//! `vendor/js8call/PROVENANCE.md`.

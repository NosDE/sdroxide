//! Subscribed element-set listings: TLEs fetched from a URL and kept current.
//!
//! Pasted elements go stale, and SGP4 on a fortnight-old TLE is worth very
//! little — [`crate::satellites::MAX_ELEMENT_AGE_S`] is where this crate stops
//! propagating them at all. Anything the operator means to keep tracking wants
//! a subscription instead of a paste.
//!
//! Two callers, one implementation:
//!
//! * The feed's worker refreshes subscriptions on the same six-hourly cadence
//!   as the amateur element set, while the solar window is open.
//! * The settings dialog fetches them on demand, so a subscription added there
//!   is usable immediately rather than at the next time the window happens to
//!   be open.
//!
//! Both go through the same disk cache as every other source, so a listing
//! fetched by either is served instantly — and offline — to the other.

//! Voice-keyer safety rails, driven through the real engine.
//!
//! The keyer is the one feature that can key the transmitter from a single
//! keypress, so what it *refuses* to do matters more than what it does. These
//! tests use a transmit-capable mock source and watch the engine's own state
//! events, so they hold regardless of what the operator has recorded (the
//! recordings themselves are covered by the unit tests in `voice.rs`).

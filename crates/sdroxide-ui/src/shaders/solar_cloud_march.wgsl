// The cloud deck again, marched instead of sliced.
//
// `solar_cloud.wgsl` samples the troposphere at a set of fixed altitudes, which
// is cheap and gets the shape right. What it cannot get right is light *inside*
// the volume: a shell knows how much cloud is above it, but a flash three
// kilometres away in the same storm either lights the shell or does not, and
// there is nothing between them to glow. Here the ray is walked instead, so the
// light from a stroke is attenuated by every metre of cloud it crosses, and a
// thunderhead lights up from within and dims towards its edges the way one
// really does.
//
// One draw covers the whole deck: a single sphere at the top of the slab, with
// the entry and exit points found analytically per fragment. It costs several
// times what the stack does, which is why the stack is the default and this is
// a switch.
//
// Everything about *what* is drawn — the height field, the optical thickness,
// where the storms are — is shared with the other path and comes from the same
// infrared mosaic. Only the integration differs.
